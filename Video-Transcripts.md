1. [Logo Goals](#Logo-Goals)

<a name="Logo-Goals"></a>

We tried to achieve a number of goals. First of all, that it should be easily accessible. There should be corners of the language that you can get into, like baby talk getting into English that are easy for the youngest beginner. But it shouldn't be a toy language. It's not that Logo is easy--it's easy to get into--but once you're in there you can progress to the most sophisticated ideas in the world of programming. Just as in English you can start off with baby talk but the same language is also the vehicle for expression of poets and philosophers.
